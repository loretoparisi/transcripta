# transcripa
Get quick romanization and IPA transcription of several languages

## Description
Transcribe some languages in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The goal is to help those who are first learning a language or want to be able to read things more easily to have something that a) romanizes the native script if necessary, and b) puts it into more-or-less correct IPA transcription to more accurately represent pronunciation and the differences between languages.
