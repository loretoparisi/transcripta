Instructions
------------

1. No installation is necessary, just extract everything to a directory.

2. If you want to add your own accent marks or language transcription, the
   XML files in the Data directory are fairly self-explanatory, and you can
   use the XSD schema provided with them for validation.

3. Enjoy.
